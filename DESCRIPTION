Description: Provides tools for sparse regression modelling with grouped predictors using the group 
    subset selection penalty. Uses coordinate descent and local search algorithms to rapidly deliver 
    near optimal estimates. The group subset penalty can be combined with a group lasso or ridge 
    penalty for added shrinkage. Linear and logistic regression are supported, as are overlapping 
    groups.
